ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .travis.yml
* _ref\
* _ref\POI_MAP.xlsx
* _ref\cuhk_location_db.js
* _ref\demo\
* _ref\demo\cmd.txt
* _ref\demo\gps_demo.txt
* _ref\demo\gps_demo1.txt
* _ref\demo\gps_demo2.txt
* _ref\fyp.zip
* _ref\net protocol\
* _ref\net protocol\Alan_Draft.pdf
* _ref\power_consuming.xlsx
* default.properties
* proguard.cfg
* release\
* release\cubt.apk
* release\cubtkey
* release\keygen.txt

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* res\ => app\src\main\res\
* src\ => app\src\main\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.
